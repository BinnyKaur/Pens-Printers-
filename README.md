Sales Strategy Evaluation

Founded in 1984, sells high-quality office products to large organization. 
Products include pens, notebooks, desk chairs, monitors and many more. 
Company wants to effectively sell its product to client and aims to build long lasting relationship with clientele. 
Company has introduced new line of office stationery and tested  following three sales strategies 

1. Email: Customers in this group received an email when the product line was launched, and a further email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team. 
2. Call: Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average members of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer. 
3. Email and call: Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product may support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around ten minutes per customer.

Business Goal - To evaluate  the sales strategies using the data and provide key insights for way ahead.

Data Validation; - 
The Dataset contains 15000 rows and 8 columns before cleaning and validation. I have validated all columns against criteria in dataset table:

1. Week - 6 values without missing values, same as description. No cleaning is needed
2. Sales_method- 3 values (Email, Call, Email +Call), 23 cells had duplicates Email+ Call as 'em+call', 1693 cells had 'email' instead of Email. Corrected those. 
3. Customer_id - 15000 unique values, same as description. No cleaning needed
4. nb_sold - Numeric, number of new products sold. 10 unique values. Values lie between 7 - 16. No cleaning needed. 
5. revenue - Numeric, revenue from the sales, rounded upto 2 decimal places. 1074 NA values found. Since there is positive linear relationship between nb_sold and revenue as displayed in scatterplot. I used multiple linear regression to predict revenue using sales method. Rounded the values to 2 decimal places. Used Inter-Quartile Range to handle outlier and validate the revenue values. 
6. year_as_customer - Numeric, number of years customer has been buying from us (company founded in 1984), Values range from 0 - 34, 1471 customers have 0 as value, I believe the customer has not completed an year yet with company. No cleaning required.
7. nb_site_vists - Numeric, number of times the customer has visited our website in the last 6 months
8. state - Character, location of the customer i.e. where orders are shipped, 50 unique values found. No cleaning required.

Data Visualization;- 
Number of customers were there for each approach

For 6 weeks, Maximum customers were for E-Mail approach (7466), followed by Call approach (4962) and at last E-Mail+ Call approach with minimum cutomers(2572). Also we can see that Sales Team reached out more customers through E-Mail within 6 weeks and also reached out more than half of that number through Call. But Email + Call approach has only 2572 customer reach. Hence there is huge room to improve that number to improve sales.

Revenue Spread Overall 
Understanding which product value (price ) resulted in highest selling value. 

We can see from the histogram visualization representing  Revenue that the value is highly concentrated around 50 and 100 considerably with wider spread 100.However, around purchases worth 50.00 it is possible to identify a peak of 1600 customers. In the same way, it is possible to detect two niches of customers with higher expenses per purchase, around 180.00 and 230.00 per purchase.
